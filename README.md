# Python_for_data_analysis

## Submited by Antoine Hazart and Jérémy Gourdeau


We runned an analysis on a dataset of F1 races since 1950


## 1. Data visualization exploration

Firstly, we did data visualization on our dataset to have basic information to understand the datas.On several variables, and by combining the datasets, we pulled information and graphs which could give us hints on what happened during a season, or a year, on different aspects. Such as evolution of ranking, speed, or pit-stops...


## 2. Preparation and modeling

Then, we prepared datas for our future modelization model. We tried to do predictions on pit stops.


## 3. Deploying flask app

By running flask run, you can use an api that we built, which can predict at a certain lap in a race, if a driver will stop or not
This was done using different machine learning comparison and algorithms on a dataframe that we created by combination of several files of this dataset.
